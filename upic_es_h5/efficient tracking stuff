Fix setup function to change particle tags to -1 and their index in track_set


These next three are from the first pmove call
missing_particles_list

This one will go through list of missing particles and then check to see if each particle
is a tracked particle.  If so, do what old function does.  This will eliminate extra search.

Inside PMOVES2_track, change the new_present_particles calls to ifs to check if it's a tracked
particle.  If so, call new new_present_particles function to update correct info.

Inside PMOVES2_track, for update_index check if tracked and then update index quickly


So after add_tag call, the new_present_particles call's functionality will be replaced by the setup.

add_track_data will be fine

I think write tracks will be okay too

update_indexes in sortp should be changed to run through all particles, check if tracked, and
if so,then update index
