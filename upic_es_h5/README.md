UPIC-ES 1.0 is a 2D electrostatic PIC code based on the UPIC 1.0 framework.  It is meant to be a production version of Viktor Decyk's  skeleton code UPIC.  It has the ability to generate HDF5 output
and can also launch nonlinear plasma waves to study the nonlinear evolution of plasma waves under fusion relevant conditions.

UPIC-ES 1.0 is currently being maintained by Frank Tsung and Ben Winjum.  Please contact them if you have questions.
