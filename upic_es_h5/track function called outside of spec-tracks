These functions are called outside of os-spec-tracks.f90

new_present_particles
write_tracks
create_file
setup   ---  called in os-spec-diagnostics.f90
cleanup ---  called in os-spec-diagnostics.f90
update_indexes
restart_write  --- called in os-spec-diagnostics.f90



put new_present_particles after particle manager call or after when ever 
	particles are passed from processor to processor
	
use the following code for the create and write_tracks functions
it should go in diagnostic calls, not quite sure now
  if ( test_if_report( n, ndump, spec%diag%ndump_fac_tracks )) then
     if ( n == 0 ) then 
        ! create the diagnostics file 
        call create_file( spec%diag%tracks, spec%name, ndump, dt, &
                          x_bnd(g_space), periodic(no_co), if_move( g_space ) )
     else 
        ! write the data
        call write_tracks( spec%diag%tracks, no_co )
     endif
  endif

call setup at start up of program

call cleanup at end

don't quite get update_indexes.  maybe call after particle sort?

don't worry about restart_write for now




ihole has list of all particles leaving a node
in pmoves2 need to call new_present_particle_single or new_present_particle_single
	depending on how you do it. Probably best to make a new array that has the index
	of all the particles that are new and then use bounds, but have to figure it out
