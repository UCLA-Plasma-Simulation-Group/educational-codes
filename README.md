# educational-codes
Repository for illustrating and exploring the physics of educational plasma physics problems.

Initially the intent is to include ~1-page pdf files, each treating a specific problem in plasma physics (e.g., landau damping, two-stream instability, etc.).  Eventually we are going to create codes that allow for the variability of certain parameters to explore the physics behind each of these problems.
